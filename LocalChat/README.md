Overview
--------

Make chats local to a certain area.  You can only talk to players that
are near you.  Far away players may be able to overhear parts of your
conversation.  Even further away players are not able to hear anything.

If you want to broadcast a message to all players in the Level use:

	.text

While if you want to broacast a message to all players in the Server
use:

	:text


Documentation
-------------

The rationale for this plugin is to add a level of distance to in-game
chats.  So if you want to talk to somebody you need to find them and
get close enough to them.

Also, you can spy in other peoples conversation, but you need to be
close enough.  If you are very close, you can hear everything.  The
farther away, you may not hear very well what is being said and the
text becomes garbled.

After certain distance you can't hear anything that is being said.

By prefixing your text with a "." to a message you can *shout* your
message to everybody in the same level.

By prefixing your text with a ":" to a message you can *broadcast*
your message to everybody in the same server.

### Configuration

These can be configured from `config.yml`:

	settings:
	  near: 10
	  far: 20

You can hear all players that are up to `near` blocks away.
You can overhear players that are up to `far` blocks away.
