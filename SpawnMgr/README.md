## Documentation

Control spawn settings in your server.

## Config notes

* **spawn-mode**: Spawn mode settings can be one of the following:
  - *default* : when joining will start at the last location.
  - *world* : when joining will always start at the last world
    spawn point.
  - *always* : when joining will always start at the default world
    spawn point.
  - *home* : when joining will start at your home location.
* **on-death-inv** allows the following values:
 - *false* : player drops all items on the spot (default)
 - *keep* : player keeps inventory
 - *clear* : player loses all inventory but nothing gets dropped
 - *perms* : Will use spawnmgr.keepinv and spawnmgr.nodrops to
   determine results

**NOTE**: The *home* *spawn-mode* requires you to have a */home*
plugin that provides with a `/home` command.  This command is executed
when the player joins.
