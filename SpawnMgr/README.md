Documentation
-------------

Control spawn settings in your server.

### Configuration

Configuration is through the `config.yml` file:

~~~
[CODE]
---
settings:
  # Explosions allowed in spawn area, set false to disallow
  tnt: true
  # PvP allowed in spawn area, set false to disallow
  pvp: true
  # If true, allows Ops to join full servers, set to a number to allow
  # only the specified number of extra slots (above max slots)
  reserved: false
  # spawn-mode: can be one of the following:
  # - *default* : when joining will start at the last location.
  # - *world* : when joining will always start at the last world
  #    spawn point.
  # - *always* : when joining will always start at the default world
  #     spawn point.
  # - *home* : when joining will start at your home location.
  spawn-mode: default
  # on-death-inv allows the following values:
  # - false : player drops all items on the spot (default)
  # - keep : player keeps inventory
  # - clear : player loses all inventory but nothing gets dropped
  # - perms : Will use spawnmgr.keepinv and spawnmgr.nodrops to
  #    determine results
  on-death-inv: false
  # If spawn-mode is *home*, this is the command to use to teleport
  # player to their home.  Requires an plugin that implements /home
  # functionality
  home-cmd: /home
# List of armor elements
armor:
- chain_chestplate
- leather_pants
- leather_boots
# List of initial inventory
items:
- STONE_SWORD,1
- WOOD,16
- COOKED_BEEF,5
# Nest Egg, granted to the player when they register through SimpleAuth
nest-egg:
- GOLD_INGOT,10
...
[/CODE]
~~~

**NOTE**: The *home* *spawn-mode* requires you to have a */home*
plugin that provides with a `/home` command.  This command is executed
when the player joins.

### Permission Nodes:

* spawnmgr.receive.armor: allows to receive armor when you spawn
* spawnmgr.receive.items: allows to receive items when you spawn
* spawnmgr.receive.nestegg: allows to receive items when you register
  to SimpleAuth
* spawnmgr.keepinv: allows player to keep inventory
* spawnmgr.nodrops: players with this permission do not drop items on death
* spawnmgr.spawnmode: player will follow spawn-control setting
* spawnmgr.reserved: Players is allowed to join full servers

Changes
-------
* 1.2.0:
  * Additional inventory on death options
  * Added Nest-Egg feature
* 1.1.0:
  * rewrite to remove offending code.
* 1.0.0 : First public release
