Simplex(Random,octaves,frequency,amplitude)
Simplex:
(OCTAVES #:int) (FREQUENCY #:float) (AMPLITUDE #:float -- Int?)

OCTAVES is the number of octaves of noise to sample,
The number of octaves control the amount of detail of Perlin
noise. Adding more octaves increases the detail of Perlin noise, with
the added drawback of increasing the calculation time.

FREQUENCY is the frequency of the first octave,  The number of cycles
per unit length that a specific coherent-noise function outputs.


AMPLITUDE is the amplitude of the first octave.  Max abs value that
can be output. (-n to +n? or just 0 to n)


* More complex terrain: Based on normal
  - Height - (Normal has *base*)
  - Incline - Multiplier to height (to generate more ruggged terrain)

  - Altitude (computed)
  - Precipitation -
  - Temperature - (softer)
  - Diversity - Changes the selection of stuff
