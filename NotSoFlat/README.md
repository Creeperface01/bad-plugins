Overview
--------

This is a simple [PocketMine-MP][3] Terrain Generator.  It is based on the
Superflat Generator, but mixes in the [Simplex Noise][1] algorithm
to generate decent looking terrain.


Documentation
-------------

### Usage

Copy to your plugins directory to install.  Use `ManyWorlds` to
generate new worlds.

If using `ManyWorlds` use the command:

	/mw create testworld 4994 notsoflat

`4994` is the seed, and you can change it to any number you want.
`testworld` is the new world being created, replace as appropriate.

### Configuration

You can configure the generator using the presets string.
The presets strings can be configured in your `server.properties`
file under the key `generator-settings`.

You can either use a predefined config or use a preset string similar
to the one used by [Superflat][2]

The following are the available pre-defined config preset strints:

- overworld
- plains
- ocean
- hills
- mountains
- flatland
- hell
- desert
- mesa
- desert hills

It is possible to control de terrain generation with greater
detail using a preset configuration string:

	nsfv1 ; blocks ; biome ; options

Where:

- nsfv1 : it is a preset version string. It is ignored.
- blocks : it is an extended block preset configuration.  You can
  especify one or more strata structures by using a "`:`" as
  separator.  You can also use a predefined string.  Predefined
  block strings:
  - temperate : mostly grassy tile set
  - arid : a harsh, mostly desert tile set
  - hell : nettherrack all around
- biome : this is ignored
- options : additional settings to tweak the terrain generator.

Because some of the code is based on PocketMine-MP Superflat
generator, it recognizes the following options:

- decoration : Will decorate the terrain with the specified objects:
  - grasscount : tall grass or flowers
  - treecount : trees

The terrain generation itself can be configured using the `dsq` option.  
_(This is an extension to the Superflat generator)_

### dsq

- waterblock : What block to use instead of water.  Could be used
  configure a lava (Block 11) sea or an ice sea.
- strata : A list of `:` (colon) separated numbers used to select
  the different strata structures.
- hell : If set, it will create a roof of Netherrack and Bedrock at
  the top of the world.
